Creation of a dashboard and KPIs for a model company (focus on Sales, Finances, Logistics, and Human Resources)

Group Project 1 at Wild Code School (3 weeks)

• Data analysis in MySql
• Data visualization in Power BI
• Client presentation and demonstration of the dashboard

The .sql files contain the code used to make sql requests, the .jpg files contain screenshots of all the pages of the final dashboard.

The project uses the MySQL sample database "classicmodels" (https://www.mysqltutorial.org/getting-started-with-mysql/mysql-sample-database/).
